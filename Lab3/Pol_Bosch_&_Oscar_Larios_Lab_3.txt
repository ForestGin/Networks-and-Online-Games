There are 2 unity packages, for the server and client unity projects.
To test the chat: 
- First "Build and Run" or hit play on editor of the GameServer unity project.

- Then to have multiple clients you can duplicate the project or build, we usually "Build and run" 
and then hit play on the editor so we have 2 clients quickly.

- Then enter the username in the input box and hit connect.

- And now you can type anything in the input box and hit enter to send the chat message.

--------------------------------------------------------

Known Bugs and difficulties:

- The server does not erase correctly the serverside gameobject that represents the player(found just 
before delivering).

- The project was aiming to have the Capsules that represent the players to wander around thus 
simulating a chat room (each with its name tag and assigned color) but lack of time and bugs
made it impossible for this delivery. 

-The base classes and functions are made using Tom Weiland's as a reference.
